# studyForwardCNN
This source codes are used to execute the forward process of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for images input. Such source code was written in the C++ Language, in which can be running in sequential or in parallel. In addition, a source code of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) was developed in R language to study the impact of dropout and regularization terms during the learning process.
